## Dialogue to renew the old philosophy of schools

El IES San Andrés es uno de los siete países participantes en un proyecto europeo Comenius dentro de Lifelong Learning Programme, modalidad Multilateral School Partnerships, Con esta asociación vamos a trabajar aspectos relacionados con la tradición, el presente y el futuro de los métodos de enseñanza de cada país, el uso del inglés como lengua integradora y la posibilidad de ampliar horizontes mentales y emocionales de nuestros estudiantes en el marco de una Europa sin fronteras.

DROPS, acrónimo de “Dialogue to renew the old philosophy of schools”, también significa “gotas” (de tradición, amor, habilidades, etc.). Es el título de nuestro proyecto. Se llevará a cabo a lo largo de dos cursos escolares 2013-2014 y 2014-2015.

El primer paso ha sido crear una página web común donde colgar todos los trabajos que los alumnos vayan haciendo: se va a elaborar un libro de recetas, un herbario, un calendario (Drops of nature) y se compararán las distintas maneras de celebrar en cada país la Navidad, el día de la madre, San Valentín,etc (Drops of love). Los alumnos también tendrán la oportunidad de conocer juegos y canciones tradicionales (Drops of tradition) y de participar en pequeñas obras de teatro.

## Objetivos

Este programa tiene los objetivos claros de fomentar entre los jóvenes y el personal educativo el conocimiento y la comprensión de la diversidad de culturas y lenguas europeas y del valor de la diversidad, ayudar a los jóvenes a adquirir las aptitudes básicas para la vida y las competencias básicas para su desarrollo personal, su futuro laboral, así como mejorar cualitativamente la movilidad del alumnado y personal educativo entre los estados miembros.

La movilidad es uno de los ejes de este programa que se materializará en el intercambio de alumnos. Un grupo de jóvenes leoneses viajarán a Polonia, Hungría, Austria, República Checa y Portugal para conocer su cultura y su forma de vida. Destaca la importancia que tendrá la práctica del inglés en todas las fases del programa.

## Zero Meeting

Ya se ha realizado la primera toma de contacto en Ankara, Turquía en este mes de octubre con la finalidad de definir las próximas tareas a realizar en los sucesivos encuentros.

El objetivo de este “Zero meeting” ha sido fomentar la comunicación entre todos los participantes y establecer lazos “afectivos y profesionales” que nos permitan colaborar armónicamente durante los dos años que dura el proyecto y sacar el máximo partido de las tareas y objetivos propuestos.

## Fantastic meeting in Vienna (December 2014)


The meeting in Vienna was fantastic, because thanks to the project we have had the opportunity to visit a beautiful city with so many marvellous and unforgettable monuments, where we met really great people and we have done many activities.

The first day at school, we exposed the power point presentations for showing to the rest of countries our Christmas traditions. We also had a wonderful welcome ceremony in which they performed rhythmic gymnastics, dance, a group of children sang and a boy of the school was playing the piano. Thanks to Comenius we got to know the different Christmas traditions of all countries, which has been really interesting and entertaining. 

Later that day, one of the participants of this proct showed us around the school. We took part in several activities in the technology workshop which taught us to make a really fantastic lamp with colourful stones and the last day we could take it home and we could finish it there.. In the gym we could make many very entertaining activities and meet people from school. In the music classroom we performed a tune using only hands and feet, emitting clicks, clapping, stomping on the floor ... and finally we had to  repeat  it but adding musical instruments. Also, we were shown to a class of young children where we made homemade Christmas balls.

We have known and visited the monuments of Vienna, especially some beautiful and impressive palaces where they told us about the history of Vienna.

We have also been able to visit the famous Schönbrunn Palace where we had a meal in the restaurant. After lunch we had a guided visit. We toured the different rooms of the palace knowing the history of the famous Empress Sissi.

Another day we made a cruise on the Danube river. In the afternoon we went to Time Travel which is a kind of attraction where we know a little more about the history of Vienna.

On this trip we shared unforgettable moments with people of other countries and we have become good friends. We have also known a little more of their cultures. We are still in contact with many of the other kids.

The last day we had a farewell dinner at school and after the dinner, we went to a club where we were dancing and talking with other project participants. The worst part of the meeting was to say goodbye to our new friends that will be surely missed.
